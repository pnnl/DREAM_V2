<h3>Designs for Risk Evaluation and Management (DREAM) Version 2.0</h3>
<p>The Designs for Risk Evaluation and Management (DREAM) tool was developed at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) as a tool to assist in determining optimal placement of monitoring devices in order to detect carbon dioxide (CO2) leakage from storage formations. The National Risk Assessment Partnership (NRAP) identified the need for a user-friendly tool with the ability to design site-specific risk-based monitoring strategies. NRAP is a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) project tasked with conducting risk and uncertainty analysis in the areas of reservoir performance, natural leakage pathways, wellbore integrity, groundwater protection, monitoring, and systems level modeling. Monitoring designs produced by DREAM may be used by stakeholders and regulators to assist in compliance with regulatory requirements developed to ensure the safety of U.S. underground sources of drinking water (USDW) and ultimately lead to safe, permanent geologic CO2 storage. Further, site-specific designs generated by DREAM allow for potential generalizations to other sites, as well as comparisons between risk-based monitoring designs and monitoring designs for other purposes, if such designs should already exist (e.g., from a Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnership [RCSP] site).</p>
<p>DREAM optimizes across user-provided output from subsurface leakage simulations, with the objective of configuring monitoring schemes that minimize time to first detection of user-specified leakage indicators. DREAM employs a simulated annealing approach that searches the solution space by iteratively mutating potential monitoring schemes built of various configurations of monitoring locations and leak detection parameters. Leakage indicators may include pressure, temperature, gas saturation, dissolved component concentrations, pH, or any other quantity that can be modeled in a physics-based simulation of porous media fluid transport. These variables are constrained by location and budget, where placement must be in a user-defined suitable location and the budget includes both the number of monitoring devices and the number of wells. The simulated annealing approach has proven to be orders of magnitude faster than an exhaustive search of the entire solution space (Yonkofski et al., 2016). While DREAM was designed with applications to CO2 leakage in mind, this flexibility allows DREAM to determine optimal monitoring locations for any contaminant transport scenario.</p>
<p>Successful use of this software requires both a proper implementation of the mathematics by the tool developers and a proper application of the tool by the user. It is strongly recommended that the user develops an understanding of the leakage system in terms of the relevant hydrogeologic behavior and chemical properties as well as the practical aspects of site-specific monitoring prior to use the DREAM tool. Successful application of the DREAM tool facilitates decision support through an enhanced understanding of the leakage system and associated solution monitoring configurations. Unsuccessful application may lead to a false understanding of the leakage system and suboptimal monitoring configurations.</p>
<p>Development of DREAM began in 2012 as part of the NRAP project, with the first code version being released in 2016. The current version of the code began development during the second phase of the NRAP program. Subsequent versions, when completed, are planned to add flexibility in the objective function, allow for a broader range of input formats, and improve existing capabilities (e.g. faster computational speeds, additional geophysical monitoring technologies).</p>

## Software Installation and Requirements
<p>DREAM requires that you have the most recent release of the Java Platform, currently version 8. If you already have Java installed, search for “About Java” to find your version. It is also recommended that the user installs an HDF5 reader, such as HDFView, for reading converted hierarchical data format (HDF5). Finally, it is recommended that the user has Python 3 with “numpy”, “h5py”, “matplotlib”, and “pandas” packages installed for some post-processing scripts to work. If you already have Python installed, you can check your version by typing “python --version” into a command prompt. Download locations for these files are shown in Table 1.
